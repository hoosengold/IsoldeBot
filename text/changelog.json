    "The Friend Updates: \n ---------------------------------------- \n\n **1.** Changed the prefix to `*` , the old prefix (`!`) is no longer supported to avoid collision with other bots. \n **2.** Added a `countdown` command. It takes hours as an input and calculates when the end of the countdown is, then messages the date. It messages everyone at the last 1 hour, 30 minutes and when the countdown ends. Type `*help` if you want to see how to use it.\n **3.** Added a typo checker. It returns a help message. \n **4.** Added an `updates` command. It returns all changes made to the newer version."
