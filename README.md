# Overview
This Multipurpose Discord Bot is perfect for small Discord Servers that need an all-in-one solution. It is currently in use - meaning this is repository is being maintained actively. This is NOT a modular bot. Some components can be removed without compromising the integrity of the bot but bugs are to be expected in that case.

# Features
The Multipurpose has the following features:
<ol>
<li>`*poll` command for creating polls with up to 20 options. Then the bot reacts automatically to the embeded message. The users can then use the reactions to vote.</li>
<li>`*countdown` command. For now, only hours can be added, but there is no upper limit \(as far as our testing councludes\). Every embeded message has a timestamp. It can be used as a reference together with the `*countdown` command.</li>
<li>*Tight integration with PostgreSQL databases.* New tables can be added without any hassle.</li>
